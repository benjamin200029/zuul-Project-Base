 *  This class is the main class of the "College of Raritan" application. 
 *  "College of Raritan" is a very simple, text based adventure game.  Users 
 *  can walk around some scenery. Pick up and drop items, eat some items, use a personal transporter.
 * 
 *  To play this game, create an instance of the class GameMain.
 * 
 *  This class creates and initialises all the others: it creates all
 *  rooms, items, player, and doors, creates the parser and starts the game.  It also evaluates and
 *  executes the commands that the parser returns.
